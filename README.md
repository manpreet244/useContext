# useContext
<h2>const value = useContext(MyContext);</h2>
<p>Accepts a context object (the value returned from React.createContext) and returns the current context value for that context. The current context value is determined by the value prop of the nearest <MyContext.Provider> above the calling component in the tree.

When the nearest <MyContext.Provider> above the component updates, this Hook will trigger a rerender with the latest context value passed to that MyContext provider. Even if an ancestor uses React.memo or shouldComponentUpdate, a rerender will still happen starting at the component itself using useContext.</p>

Donâ€™t forget that the argument to useContext must be the context object itself:

  <h4>Correct: useContext(MyContext)</h4>
  <p>A component calling useContext will always re-render when the context value changes. If re-rendering the component is expensive, you can optimize it by using memoization.</p>
